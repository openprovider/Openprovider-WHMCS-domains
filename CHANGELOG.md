# Changelog

## v5.8.4

### Features and improvements
* Added a **Consent to Publish Domain Contact Data** option for gTLDs in domain registration, transfer, and and domain modification (WHMCS Admin Area) pages - Personal data is redacted by default to protect registrants privacy according to GDPR. Explicit consent is now required to publish private contact details publicly to registrar WHOIS/RDAP.

## v5.8.3

###### Features and improvements
* Added .es transfer auth code support (ensure to select **[EPP Code](https://docs.whmcs.com/domains/pricing-and-configuration/domain-pricing/#epp-code)** checkbox for .es in **Domain Pricing** to require an EPP code for incoming transfers of .es domains). 
* Added .dk Terms & Conditions Acceptance checkbox - .DK Registry made changes to the flow of .DK domain names, making it mandatory for domain owners to accept T&C's of the registry before registering a .dk domain name. 
* Generate a new auth code on clicking 'Get EPP Code' button in WHMCS if domain auth code is empty (for supported TLDs).

###### Bugfixes
* Fixed: Resolved an issue with converting checkbox values to strings.
* Fixed error accessing admin dashboard - `Argument #2 ($array) must be of type array, null given in ../DocBlock/Tags/InvalidTag.php:89`
* Updated the getOrDefault() function and default value of 'require_op_dns_servers' in advanced-module-configurations.php file.

## v5.8.0

###### Features and improvements
- **Improved [TLD Price Sync](https://github.com/openprovider/Openprovider-WHMCS-domains/blob/version-8/docs/TLD_Pricing_sync_Utility.md)** - Fetch TLD prices with a single click from WHMCS. If prices were fetched via within last 24 hours, we will use the downloaded prices to speed up the operation.
- **Improved [DNSSEC management for end users](https://github.com/openprovider/Openprovider-WHMCS-domains/blob/version-8/docs/DNSSEC_for_clients.md)** - Manually copying contents from 'custom-pages' to root folder is no longer required if your hosting environment permits. Made it easier to manage DNSSEC.
- **Improved error reporting and logging** - Errors will be shown in WHMCS without restrictions. New informative error messages added for some scenarios.
- **Improved Configuration Validation** - The module now uses WHMCS recommended `_config_validate` function to check whether the credentials and environment are correct.
- **Auto-renew** - Domains will be created with auto-renew value "default" (will inherit reseller account settings)
- **New**: [To-Do List](https://docs.whmcs.com/admins/admin-tools/#to-do-list) items creation for domain operation warnings in success response.
